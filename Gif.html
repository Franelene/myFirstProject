  <h2> The Effect This Gif Has On Me </h2>
<p> 
I was not motivated or had self awareness. I allowed my friends and drug addictions to get the best of me. I was not focused on myself. I was easily influenced by bad company. I knew I wanted better for myself but did not have the right company around me to give me that drive I need to towards my goals.  I am not blaming nobody else but myself though. I was not happy with myself and I was chasing after all the wrong things. I was trying to live A young, wild, and free lifestyle. I was always out late, under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and my priorities and responsibilities was never in order. My scholastic performance was excellent in both institutions. It was just my attendance. I had such long nights I would always come late, or take days of off to recover. Not being mindful of the goals I set to achieve for myself. </p>
