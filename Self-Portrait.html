<h2> My Inspiration of This Self Project </h2>

<p> I decided to use a mountain coaster and a photo from my happiest moment because I believe that everyday everyone goes through challenges to take control and maintain happiness in their life. As a teenager, I was like the mountain coaster going to the top by itself. I was alone with no guidance about what I was about to face as an adult. I was worried about the heights, and speeds I would go to make myself happy. As I got older, and got to the top of the mountain to control how I was going to maintain my happiness. My fears of being on my own as a young adult in college inspires me most to become a successful person in my career as a film director. I had to overcome a lot of obstacles and learn how to prioritize and be flexible when sharp loops and turns came in my way. My goal is to use video arts and technology to show how my emotions and personality is very important to me. I will be able to use what I am learning  and experiences as a platform to express myself by taking control of my business at my own speed.</p>
