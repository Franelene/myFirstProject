<h1> About Franelene </h1>

<p> My name is Franny.  I am a 23 years old, full time student at BMCC college. My profession is a para professional in Brooklyn and Manhattan Charter schools. I can cook and provide groceries. I like to have a clean and organize environment. Especially in bathrooms and kitchens.  I am single. I do not smoke or drink. On my free time and off days. I like to catch up on shows and watch alot of Netflix series. I do yoga, go out to socialize and network with friends. Spend time with my family for special occasions. I try to keep myself busy to stay out the way. But when I am at home, I like a drama free and a serene atmosphere. I am very understanding, outgoing, and down to earth. I want to achieve my goals to become a film director. So my main goal to remain focus and work hard to finish school and continue to be determine to get ahead in life while going through life obstacles one day at a time. Iâ€™m just trying to keep elevating myself to be better everyday. </p>
