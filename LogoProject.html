<h1> The Process Of Creating This Logo</h1>

<ol> 

<li> I used Adobe Illustrator to create this logo.</li>

<li> I image traced a photo of a feather from google.</li>

<li> I chose the colors lavender and baby blue because i want the business to get the target audience of all people. The colors gives a warm welcome feeling. I used the glow and ombre affect to show a transition and blend of emotions.</li> 

<li> The name <q>Franny 2.0</q> is to show a transition between my years as teenager into adulthood. Franny is my nickname. And with 2.0 is to explain that I'm maturing and making better choices in my life toward my career. 
 The bold letters depicts that this a serious company. </li>

 <li>New Beginning Production is the official name that i will like to name my business. I want New Beginnings Production to help independent filmmakers with unique films contribute to society get their films funded. They can include narrative films, documentaries, short films, and web series with compelling and powerful stories, told with passion. </li>

<p>
When creating this logo, I wanted to bring my idea of production company to life. I used a feather to symbolize New Beginnings. It shows the a soft side and organized pattern of my life. From my experiences, I learn that I had to humble myself or life will do it for me. I knew I wanted to be successful and I just had to start making better choices. This time around, I stick to what I know. I made a schedule that fits with my work schedule and gave myself days off to study. My school is convenient, and diverse. I came to BMCC for Associates in Video Arts and Technology, because I love communications media. I am good with computers and desktop publishing, growing up I always wanted to own my own business and be able to use my knowledge as a platform to express myself. When graduating, I will like to be a Film Director. I feel like my past mistakes makes me a better person today. I know that I am not giving up on myself again. My priorities are in order and I am doing whatever it takes to graduate, I am much more ambitious and want to do the right things to make my family proud, but most importantly I want to make myself proud.
